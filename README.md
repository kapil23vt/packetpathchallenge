# packetpathchallenge

Please follow the following steps to execute the program and interpret the results.

1. Make sure you have the both binary files in the same directory as of source code.
2. Make sure you have the gcc compiler installed.
3. You can then compile the code using gcc main.c
4. After error free compilation, a.out file is generated.
5. Code then can be executed using ./a.out file1.txt file2.txt

Assumptions:

The code prints the next 16 bytes or 128 bits from file1.txt and file2.txt from the mismatch index.
If 16 bytes are not available from the mismatch, program will display the contents till the end of the file.
